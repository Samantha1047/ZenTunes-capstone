**ZenTunes**: Personalized Soundscapes for Relaxation and Focus

## Overview

ZenTunes is a interactive React JS application designed to allow users to create their own personalized ambient soundscapes. By selecting an environment and adding sound elements, users can tailor the ambiance to enhance relaxation or concentration.

### Problem

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, finding the right ambient sounds for relaxation or focus can be a time-consuming task. There is a need for a customizable solution that allows individuals to quickly and easily craft an auditory environment that suits their needs.

### User Profile

The primary users of this application are individuals seeking to enhance their work or relaxation environments. Users can interactively choose and modify sound elements to create a soundscape that fits their personal preference or mood.

### Features

- **Environment Selection:** Users can choose from various ambient environments like rainy outdoor, seaside, forest, and indoors.
- **Hover to preview:** When users hover over the selection button, the preview sound will play, and the website will switch to a dynamic background.
- **Sound Element Customization:** Each environment comes with unique sound elements that users can add to their mix, and each element has variations.
- **Real Time Mixing:** Users have individual control over the base layer ambient sounds and element sounds, allowing real-time mixing to find the best sound they want.
- **Loop Forever if Needed:** Users can leave the page open to continuously hear the sound. They don't need to worry about the soundtrack running out; it's always there for you!
