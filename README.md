**ZenTunes** is an interactive React JS application designed to allow users to create their own personalized ambient soundscapes. By selecting an environment and adding sound elements, users can do real-time mixing to tailor the ambiance to enhance relaxation or concentration.

### Features

- **Environment Selection:** Users can choose from various ambient environments like rainy outdoor, seaside, forest, and indoors.
- **Hover to Preview:** When users hover over the selection button, the preview sound will play, and the website will switch to a dynamic background.
- **Sound Element Customization:** Each environment comes with unique sound elements that users can add to their mix, and each element has variations.
- **Real-Time Mixing:** Users have individual control over the base layer ambient sounds and element sounds, allowing real-time mixing to find the best sound they want.
- **Loop Forever if Needed:** Users can leave the page open to continuously hear the sound. They don't need to worry about the soundtrack running out; it's always there for you!
